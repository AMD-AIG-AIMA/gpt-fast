      "Rodin's \"The Burghers of Calais\" marked a significant departure from established traditions of sculpture in several ways:\n\n### 1. **Realism and Individuality**\n   - Rodin portrayed the six burghers as individual, flawed humans rather than idealized or heroic figures. Each figure exhibits unique facial expressions and body language that convey their emotions and psychological states. This focus on realism and individual personality signaled a break from the classical sculptural tradition of idealized forms and generic representations.\n\n### 2."

      "To keep rhythm exciting and active, **variety** is essential. \n\nIn the context of the image, the rhythm in the restaurant's design is achieved through the varying patterns and textures of the wooden slats on the wall. The interplay of horizontal and vertical lines, along with the alternating use of light and dark wood, creates a dynamic visual rhythm. This variety keeps the space visually engaging and prevents it from appearing monotonous."
