      "To keep rhythm exciting and active, variation is essential. In the context of the image, the varying patterns and sizes of the wooden and white panels on the wall, as well as the alternating placement of tables, chairs, and seating areas, demonstrate a sense of rhythm and movement through visual variation. This helps prevent stagnation and keeps the space visually stimulating."
