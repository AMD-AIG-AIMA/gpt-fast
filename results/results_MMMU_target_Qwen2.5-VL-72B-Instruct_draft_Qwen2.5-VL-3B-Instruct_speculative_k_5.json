      "Rodin's *The Burghers of Calais* signaled a departure from established traditions of sculpture in several key ways:\n\n1. **Realism and Expressiveness**: Unlike traditional sculpture that often idealized figures and emphasized heroic or idealized beauty, Rodin\u2019s work portrays the six burghers as ordinary men with individual, expressive faces that convey their suffering and deep emotional experience.

The wall pattern here introduces a dynamic rhythm with its alternating light and dark wooden slats, creating visual interest and preventing the space from feeling monotonous. The interplay of these elements keeps the rhythm visually engaging."
