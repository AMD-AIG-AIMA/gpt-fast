      "Rodin's *The Burghers of Calais* marked a significant departure from traditional sculptural conventions in several ways. One of the most notable innovations was his approach to realism and the portrayal of human emotion. Instead of depicting his subjects in idealized, heroic poses, Rodin chose to present the six burghers in a moment of profound human vulnerability and sacrifice.\n\n### Key Innovations:\n\n1. **Realism and Emotional Depth**:\n   - Rodin's figures are not idealized or noble"

      "To keep rhythm exciting and active, **variety** is essential. In the context of design, as shown in the image of the restaurant interior, patterns and repetitions can create a sense of rhythm. The wooden slats on the wall, for example, establish a visual rhythm. However, introducing variety in the form of different textures, colors, or shapes prevents the rhythm from becoming monotonous and keeps the space engaging and dynamic. The mix of seating options, color accents, and lighting in the image"
