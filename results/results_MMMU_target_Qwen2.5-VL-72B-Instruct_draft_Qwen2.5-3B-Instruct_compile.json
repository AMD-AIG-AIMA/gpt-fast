      "Auguste Rodin's *The Burghers of Calais* signaled a departure from established traditions of sculpture in several innovative ways:\n\n1. **Realism and Emotional Expression**: Rodin emphasized realism and raw emotional expression over idealized beauty. The figures are depicted with flaws and shown in moments of deep sorrow and distress, reflecting the tragic historical event they represent.\n\n2. **Lack of Heroic Elevation**: Unlike traditional sculptures that often placed figures on pedestals to elevate them, Rodin had"

      "To keep rhythm exciting and active, **variety** is essential. \n\nIn terms of design, the image shows a pattern that uses repeated elements (the wooden slats), but the rhythm is made more exciting by the introduction of variety in the form of different colors (white and brown sections) and irregular spacing. This variety adds visual interest and prevents the rhythm from becoming monotonous. The same principle applies in music and other forms of rhythm, where changes in notes, beats, or tempo keep the rhythm"
