      "Rodin's \"The Burghers of Calais\" marked a significant departure from established traditions of sculpture in several ways:\n\n1. **Realism and Individuality**: Unlike traditional heroic or idealized sculptures, Rodin portrayed each of the six burghers with extraordinary realism and individuality. Each figure has a distinct appearance, expression, and posture, reflecting their emotional state and individual personalities. This was a departure from the uniformity and idealized beauty that were common in classical sculpture.\n\n2."

      "To keep rhythm exciting and active, **variety** is essential. In the context of the image provided, which shows a modern dining area with a patterned wall, the rhythm in the design is kept exciting and active through a combination of varying elements such as differing lengths and widths of the wooden slats, the alternating use of wood and white surfaces, and the strategic placement of furniture. These elements create a dynamic visual rhythm that engages the viewer and prevents monotony."
