      "Rodin's 'The Burghers of Calais' signaled his departure from established traditions of sculpture in several ways:\n\n1. **Realism and Individuality**: Unlike traditional heroic statues, Rodin focused on the emotional and psychological states of ordinary people. Each figure in the sculpture appears unique and individual, with distinct postures and expressions that convey suffering and resignation. This emphasis on realism and the depiction of raw human emotion was a departure from the idealized and heroic styles prevalent at the time.\n\n2. **"

This can be seen in the image where the design of the wall uses a combination of different elements\u2014wood, white panels, and patterns\u2014to create an engaging and dynamic visual rhythm. The spacing and repetition of these elements also contribute to a sense of movement and interest, preventing monotony."
